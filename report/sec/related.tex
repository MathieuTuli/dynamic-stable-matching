\paragraph{Stable Matching}
In their 1962 paper~\cite{galeshapley1962}, Gale and Shapeley first proposed the classical stable matching problem and the corresponding
Gale-Shapeley algorithm, with two versions: the Men-Proposing Deferred Acceptance (MPDA) algorithm and the Women-Proposing Deferred Acceptance (MPDA) algorithm. Both versions are proven to generate a stable matching and terminate in $n^2$ moves and less~\cite{irving1989textbook}. MPDA is man-optimal where every women gets her worst possible partner, while WPDA is woman-optimal. To address the imbalance, Irving et al.~\cite{irving1987efficient} further proposed a sex-optimal stable matching algorithm that operates at $\mathcal{O}(n^4)$.

\paragraph{Stable Matching Variants}
There are many variants of the stable matching problem. The survey paper by Iwama and Miyazaki~\cite{iwama2008survey} provides a comprehensive overview of the popular variants, including the many-to-one matching (Hospitals/Residents Matching Problem), non-bipartite matching (Roommates Matching Problem), many-to-many matching, three-dimensional matching with three parties, and preferences with incomplete lists and/or ties. In addition, Anshelevich et al.~\cite{Anshelevich2013} extend preference profile with numerical utilities to analyze the overall social welfare of stable matching. We share the same notion of numerical utilities when evaluating social welfare as~\cite{Anshelevich2013}, but none of the existing settings consider the dimension of time, so our setting remains novel.
