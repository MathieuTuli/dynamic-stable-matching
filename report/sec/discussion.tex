\section{Discussion}
In this work we introduce the dynamic stable matching setting where each agent's preference profile is associated with an underlying numerical utilities vector, which is subject to change over time. Hence, a good matching algorithm needs to produce matching that respects both social welfare and the longevity of marriages over time. Our empirical evaluations show that the classical stable matching algorithms produce very inconsistent matching that also does not have high social welfare in settings with more agents and longer time horizon, compared to a few other matching algorithms. A future direction is ...
