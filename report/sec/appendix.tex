\section{Stability vs. Social Welfare}
\paragraph{Max social welfare $\nRightarrow$ stability} Consider two men and two women where $m_1$ has utility 1 towards $w_1$ and utility 0 towards $w_2$, $m_2$ has utility 0.6 towards $w_1$ and 0.4 towards $w_2$, $w_1$ has utility 0.4 towards $m_1$ and 0.6 towards $m_2$, and $w_2$ has utility 0 towards $m_1$ and 1 towards $m_2$. In this setting, $M = \{(w_1, m_1), (w_2, m_2)\}$ is the matching that maximizes social welfare, but it is not stable as $m_2$ and $w_1$ both prefer each other more than the matched partner.

\paragraph{Stability $\nRightarrow$ max social welfare} In the setting above, $M' = \{(m_1, w_2), (m_2, w_1)\}$ is a stable pair, but it achieves less social welfare than $M$.
